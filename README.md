This plugin was started by DarthSalamon who coded the original plugin. Wild1145 then took over the plugin at a later date and is currently actively maintaining and improving the plugin. This plugin currently has over 10 custom coded commands and is growing. This along with unique features available on the DarthCraft server means our players continue to enjoy a safe and fun survival server!
